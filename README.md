Propensify: Propensity Model for Marketing Campaign Optimization
Overview
Propensify is a propensity modeling tool designed to forecast the likelihood that potential customers will respond to marketing campaigns. This tool aims to help businesses optimize their marketing efforts by identifying target groups with the highest probability of engagement.

Problem Statement
Many businesses invest heavily in data-driven campaigns to predict customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies. However, the actual outcomes of these campaigns often fall short. By leveraging propensity modeling, we can predict the likelihood of customers engaging in specific actions, providing valuable insights into when, why, and how customers make purchasing decisions.

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a propensity model that will help an insurance company optimize their marketing efforts by identifying potential customers from a given dataset.

Data
Training Data: train.csv - Historical data provided by the insurance company.
Test Data: test.csv - List of potential customers to whom the marketing campaign might be directed.
Note: Use only the listed columns in the provided datasets. Ignore any additional columns.

Recommended Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and understand the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
Data Cleaning: Standardize data, handle missing values, and address outliers.
Dealing with Imbalanced Data: Balance the data using appropriate techniques before model building.
Feature Engineering: Create or transform features to enhance model performance.
Model Selection: Choose the most suitable machine learning model for this project.
Model Training: Split the data into training and test sets. Use the training set to estimate the best model parameters.
Model Validation: Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data to estimate its ability to generalize and identify any issues like overfitting.
Model Deployment: Prepare the model for use in a production environment.
Timeline
Submission Deadline: 2 weeks from project start date.
